                    <h3>
                        Magnetic Materials
                    </h3>
                    <p> Magnetic materials are substances that can be magnetized or attracted to a magnetic field. They
                        are used in many applications such as electric motors, generators, transformers, recording media
                        and other devices. Magnetic materials have been studied for centuries due to their ability to
                        produce attractive forces on each other
                        and interact with electromagnetic fields \cite{gabay_magnetism:_2011}. This paper will discuss
                        various types of
                        magnetic materials including ferromagnetic materials, paramagnetic materials, ferrimagnetic
                        materials and
                        antiferromagnetic material. The properties of these different types of magnetic material will be
                        discussed along with the equations
                        needed to calculate them.

                    <h3>Ferromagnets </h3>
                    <p>
                        The most common type of magnetic material is the ferromagnet which exhibits strong permanent
                        magnetism
                        at ambient
                        temperatures without any additional external field \cite{douglass_ferro-and_1959}. Ferromagnets
                        typically contain iron
                        (Fe) but may also contain cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) or some alloys containing these elements like
                        Alnico
                        which contains
                        Aluminium(Al), Nickel(Ni) and Cobalt(Co). These elements form domains within the ferromagnet
                        where each
                        domain acts like
                        a tiny bar magnet with its own north and south pole
                        \cite{stenger_magneticdomainsinstructablecom_.2019}.
                        If enough
                        domains line up in one direction then they combine together creating an overall macroscopic
                        magnetic
                        moment known as
                        spontaneous magnetization $M_{s}$ defined by Equation 1 below;

                        $$ M_{s} = N_{A}\mu$$
                        where $\mu$ is the Bohr Magneton given by Equation 2;
                        $$\mu= 927400~Am^2/kg$$
                        and $N_{A}$, Avogadro's number given by equation 3; $$N_{A}=
                        6.02214076*10^{23}{molecules/mol.}$$\\ \\

                    <h3>Ferrimagnets</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ferrimagnets are similar to feromagnets except instead of having only one kind of atomic element
                        there is two kinds present in opposite proportions \cite{oommfuserguide2016}. This makes it so
                        that when aligned in one direction there exists a net dipolar moment between the two unlike
                        atoms resulting from their competing moments causing them both not fully cancel out creating
                        what’s called an induced moment $\mathcal {M _i }$. The equilibrium state between this induced
                        moment and interaction energy causes what’s called an exchange bias force $E _B$ which can be
                        described using Equation 4 below; $$ E _B = -2KV + 2J{\mathcal {M _i }} ^2 $$ where $ K $
                        represents uniaxial anisotropy
                        constant, $J$ represents exchange coupling constant $V$, volume per unit cell respectively. As
                        $K$ &
                        $J$ gets larger more
                        energy must be supplied to make changes in alignment thus making stronger magnets with higher
                        coercives fields.

                    <h3>Paramagnets</h3>
                    <p>
                        Paramagnetic Materials are different than Ferro & Ferri Magnets because unlike those two
                        Paramagneitcs
                        don't show any signifiant amount spontanous polarization but when exposed to certain external
                        electromagnetic fields
                        they become somewhat polarized resulting from aligning electron orbitals parallel or
                        antiparallel resulting from
                        something called spin-orbit coupling . Paramagents however exhibit high degree susceptibility
                        meaning their mometns
                        increase exponentially when exposed under certain conditions shown via equation 5 :
                        $$ X = C + B H^2 +DH^4+FH^6 ...etc... $$
                        here $X$ represent susceptibility while $BH$ term stands for linear response while $DH&FH$ terms
                        stand for
                        nonlinear responses usually found at lower temps indicating temperature dependent behaviour.

                    <h3>Antiferomagents</h3>
                    <p>
                        Antiferomagentic Materials Unlike previous three do not retain any residual magentization even
                        if subjected under very large applied
                        external feilds due their atomic spins being antiparallel cancelling out each othesr effect this
                        creates something known as
                        compensated point were no net momemtum exist giving rise too compensation temperature
                        Tcompensation shown via
                        eqution 6 :
                        $$Tcompensation = {\frac{{C'}}{{|{\bf S1}{\bf S2|}}}} $$ Where $C'$ represens interatomic
                        exchange
                        coupline constant while ${S1}, {S2 }$ refers tor ther magnettic moments acting on either site
                        respectively .

                    we saw how every individual type of magnets has unique charachteristics depending upon
                    environemental
                    parameters such us tempertaure, pressure etc therefore proper understanding of such materials
                    requires deeper
                    look into individual components leading towards development fo new age technology based upon new
                    findings made
                    throughout the research process.

                    Applications of Lasers
                </article>
                <article>
                    There are multiple LASER applications. Here are some of them:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Data Storage: Lasers are used to read and write data on CDs, DVDs, and other media storage
                            devices. The laser reads
                            the information from a disk by shining light onto its surface and reflecting it back off of
                            various layers in the disk.
                            It can then detect changes in reflected light intensity representing stored data bits
                            (formula: n = 2^n where n is the
                            number of bits).
                            Let us get into its details. Data storage involves storing files digitally on discs such as
                            CDs, DVDs, etc.; these discs
                            contain microscopic bumps inside them, which act as 0s and 1s representing binary code
                            depending upon their presence or
                            absence, respectively. A laser beam shines onto these bumps producing different intensities
                            depending upon their
                            presence, i.e., whether they reflect back any signal, thereby forming readable chunks
                            representing the entire file. Once
                            formed, this file can be accessed anytime just by reading these tiny pits again with the
                            help of the same technology.
                        </li>
                        <li>Laser Cutting/Welding: Lasers are commonly used for cutting or welding materials such as
                            metal or plastic using a
                            process called “heat conduction,” which uses heat generated by the laser beam to melt
                            through the material (formula:
                            Heat = Power x Time). This process reduces waste compared to traditional cutting methods,
                            allowing finer cuts with more
                            precise control over the material shape.
                        </li>
                        <li>Optical Fiber Communication Systems: Lasers are employed in fiber optic communication
                            systems that use optical fibers
                            instead of electrical wires to transmit signals between locations (formula: c = fλ where c
                            is the speed of light, f is
                            frequency, λ is wavelength). Light pulses carrying digital information travel down these
                            cables at incredibly high
                            speeds, making them an efficient way to quickly send large amounts of data over long
                            distances without interference from
                            external sources like radio waves or electric fields.
                        </li>
                        <li>Laser Printing: Laser printing involves using lasers to transfer images onto paper (formulas
                            not applicable). The
                            printer contains a photoconductor drum that stores electrons when exposed to light and
                            transfers those electrons onto
                            paper when heated up, causing toner particles attached to the paper fibers to create text or
                            graphics on pages printed
                            from the device. This method provides higher-resolution prints than inkjet printers, with
                            sharper details and deeper
                            colors due to increased accuracy during transfer processes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Medical Applications: Lasers have many medical applications, including vision correction
                            surgery, also known as
                            LASIK, which reshapes corneal tissue so that it better focuses incoming light into one
                            single focal point on the retina(
                            formula: P=F/D where P is power density, F is total energy outputted per unit time & D
                            stands for distance ) This
                            procedure has been immensely successful since its introduction due firstly because this
                            technique requires no incision
                            &damage caused during surgery couldn't be reversed if something went wrong secondly results
                            were predictable & accurate
                            thus becoming popular among people who wanted improved vision without undergoing risky
                            surgeries like Radial keratotomy,
                            etc.
