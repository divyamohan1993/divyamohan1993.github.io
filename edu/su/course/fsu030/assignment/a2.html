                        Magnetic Materials
                    </h3>
                    <p> Magnetic materials are substances that can be magnetized or attracted to a magnetic field. They
                        are used in many applications such as electric motors, generators, transformers, recording media
                        and other devices. Magnetic materials have been studied for centuries due to their ability to
                        produce attractive forces on each other
                        and interact with electromagnetic fields \cite{gabay_magnetism:_2011}. This paper will discuss
                        various types of
                        magnetic materials including ferromagnetic materials, paramagnetic materials, ferrimagnetic
                        materials and
                        antiferromagnetic material. The properties of these different types of magnetic material will be
                        discussed along with the equations
                        needed to calculate them.

                    <h3>Ferromagnets </h3>
                    <p>
                        The most common type of magnetic material is the ferromagnet which exhibits strong permanent
                        magnetism
                        at ambient
                        temperatures without any additional external field \cite{douglass_ferro-and_1959}. Ferromagnets
                        typically contain iron
                        (Fe) but may also contain cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) or some alloys containing these elements like
                        Alnico
                        which contains
                        Aluminium(Al), Nickel(Ni) and Cobalt(Co). These elements form domains within the ferromagnet
                        where each
                        domain acts like
                        a tiny bar magnet with its own north and south pole
                        \cite{stenger_magneticdomainsinstructablecom_.2019}.
                        If enough
                        domains line up in one direction then they combine together creating an overall macroscopic
                        magnetic
                        moment known as
                        spontaneous magnetization $M_{s}$ defined by Equation 1 below;

                        $$ M_{s} = N_{A}\mu$$
                        where $\mu$ is the Bohr Magneton given by Equation 2;
                        $$\mu= 927400~Am^2/kg$$
                        and $N_{A}$, Avogadro's number given by equation 3; $$N_{A}=
                        6.02214076*10^{23}{molecules/mol.}$$\\ \\

                    <h3>Ferrimagnets</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ferrimagnets are similar to feromagnets except instead of having only one kind of atomic element
                        there is two kinds present in opposite proportions \cite{oommfuserguide2016}. This makes it so
                        that when aligned in one direction there exists a net dipolar moment between the two unlike
                        atoms resulting from their competing moments causing them both not fully cancel out creating
                        what’s called an induced moment $\mathcal {M _i }$. The equilibrium state between this induced
                        moment and interaction energy causes what’s called an exchange bias force $E _B$ which can be
                        described using Equation 4 below; $$ E _B = -2KV + 2J{\mathcal {M _i }} ^2 $$ where $ K $
                        represents uniaxial anisotropy
                        constant, $J$ represents exchange coupling constant $V$, volume per unit cell respectively. As
                        $K$ &
                        $J$ gets larger more
                        energy must be supplied to make changes in alignment thus making stronger magnets with higher
                        coercives fields.

                    <h3>Paramagnets</h3>
                    <p>
                        Paramagnetic Materials are different than Ferro & Ferri Magnets because unlike those two
                        Paramagneitcs
                        don't show any signifiant amount spontanous polarization but when exposed to certain external
                        electromagnetic fields
                        they become somewhat polarized resulting from aligning electron orbitals parallel or
                        antiparallel resulting from
                        something called spin-orbit coupling . Paramagents however exhibit high degree susceptibility
                        meaning their mometns
                        increase exponentially when exposed under certain conditions shown via equation 5 :
                        $$ X = C + B H^2 +DH^4+FH^6 ...etc... $$
                        here $X$ represent susceptibility while $BH$ term stands for linear response while $DH&FH$ terms
                        stand for
                        nonlinear responses usually found at lower temps indicating temperature dependent behaviour.

                    <h3>Antiferomagents</h3>
                    <p>
                        Antiferomagentic Materials Unlike previous three do not retain any residual magentization even
                        if subjected under very large applied
                        external feilds due their atomic spins being antiparallel cancelling out each othesr effect this
                        creates something known as
                        compensated point were no net momemtum exist giving rise too compensation temperature
                        Tcompensation shown via
                        eqution 6 :
                        $$Tcompensation = {\frac{{C'}}{{|{\bf S1}{\bf S2|}}}} $$ Where $C'$ represens interatomic
                        exchange
                        coupline constant while ${S1}, {S2 }$ refers tor ther magnettic moments acting on either site
                        respectively .

                <article>
                    we saw how every individual type of magnets has unique charachteristics depending upon
                    environemental
                    parameters such us tempertaure, pressure etc therefore proper understanding of such materials
                    requires deeper
                    look into individual components leading towards development fo new age technology based upon new
                    findings made
                    throughout the research process.
