                    Electromagnetic Waves (EM Waves)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We studied Energy, a measure of the ability to do work, comes in many forms and can transform from
                    one type to
                    another. An example of
                    stored or potential energy include batteries and water behind a dam and Objects in motion are
                    examples
                    of kinetic energy.

                    Charged particles—such as electrons and protons—create electromagnetic fields when they move, and
                    these fields transport
                    the type of energy which we call an electromagnetic radiation, or light. Electromagnetic radiations
                    are composed of electromagnetic waves that are produced when an
                    electric field comes in
                    contact with the magnetic field. A changing magnetic field will induce a changing electric field and
                    vice-versa—the two are linked.
                    These changing fields
                    form electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not
                    require a medium to
                    propagate.

                    Electromagnetic waves were first postulated by James Clerk Maxwell and subsequently confirmed by
                    Heinrich Hertz. Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, applied Maxwell's theories to the production and
                    reception of radio waves. The unit
                    of frequency of a radio wave -- one cycle per second -- is named the hertz, in honor of Heinrich
                    Hertz.
                    Electromagnetic waves are created as a result of vibrations between an electric and
                    a magnetic
                    field. It can also be said that electromagnetic waves are the composition
                    of oscillating
                    electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic waves are solutions of Maxwell's equations, which are
                    the fundamental
                    equations of electrodynamics.

                <h3>
                    How EM waves are formed.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Electromagnetic waves are formed when an electric field comes in contact with a magnetic field. They
                    are hence known as
                    'electromagnetic' waves. The electric field and magnetic field of an electromagnetic wave are
                    perpendicular (at right
                    angles) to each other.

                    Technological Applications of Electromagnetic Waves
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Ever wonder how your mobile phone can carry your voice to someone else across the world? It does so
                    by using
                    electromagnetic waves. These are fluctuations in magnetic and electric fields that can travel
                    through space. Since they
                    have no tether to physical material, they can pass through walls, buildings, and even our bodies.

                    Electromagnetic waves play a massive role in our lives. We can enjoy mobile phones, radio, TV, and
                    more by controlling
                    and manipulating these waves. Light testing equipment also checks for the presence of EM waves. So,
                    EM waves are much
                    more relevant than we might think. Delve into some of the technological applications of
                    electromagnetic waves and
                    discover how they’ve been making our lives easier for decades.

                    <h4>
                        Radio Waves
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        First, we'll examine the most common application of EM waves—radio waves. A radio wave can
                        broadcast
                        FM and AM radio
                        signals, but it can also do more. Your television uses radio waves to broadcast the signal from
                        various TV stations
                        (assuming you're watching analog TV instead of streaming). Finally, radio waves have
                        applications in
                        the military
                        through radar. That's why radar and radio begin with the same three letters.

                    <h4>
                        Microwaves
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Another form of an EM wave is a microwave. As you probably guessed, these are the waves that a
                        household microwave uses
                        to heat food. That's not their only use, though. Microwaves are pretty similar to radio waves as
                        they're also used for
                        communication. TV stations use microwaves to send their signals out to longer distances.

                    <h4>
                        Infrared Waves
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        An infrared wave generates heat, and it's also used in TV remote controls. In today's age,
                        Bluetooth
                        technology
                        has
                        primarily replaced infrared. Yet, infrared waves are necessary for creating heat-vision and
                        night-vision
                        cameras. That's
                        because every living creature emits heat, which is infrared waves. That means anything that gets
                        hot
                        is
                        producing a lot
                        of infrared waves.

                    <h4>
                        X- Rays
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        An x-ray is simply a form of EM wave used for internal photography. It uses a penetrating form
                        of EM
                        radiation
                        to take
                        pictures inside your body. The medical field uses the same EM radiation type as a cancer
                        treatment.
                        The
                        radiation is
                        concentrated in a high-energy form to eliminate cancer cells.

                            and electric fields are perpendicular to each other.</p>

                        Reflection of Electromagnetic Waves
                        <p>The Electromagnetic wave is having the characteristics of reflection just like the light
                            waves.
                            It means that
                            when electromagnetic waves strike to the surface of conducting material, they are reflected
                            back
                            as shown in the

                        Refraction of Electromagnetic Waves
                        <p>The electromagnetic waves also have the characteristics of reflection. It means that when the
                            electromagnetic
                            waves inters from one medium to another, it bends towards the normal or away from the normal
                            while traveling in
                            the next medium. When the electromagnetic waves inter form rare medium to dens medium, it
                            bends
                            towards the
                            normal and when the electromagnetic inter from dens to rare medium it bends away from the

                        Intensity of Electromagnetic Waves
                        <p>The intensity of electromagnetic waves depends on the electrical field strength of the wave.
                            It
                            means that if the
                            field strength of electromagnetic waves is more, its intensity will be more and vice
                            versa.<br />The electrical
                            field strength is measured in V/m volt per meter. For the microwave it's measured in micro
                            volt
                            per meter µv/m.

                            to
                            load. This loss
                            of energy is known as attenuation of the electromagnetic waves. The attenuation occurs due
                            to
                            buildings, tree's,

                            these fields are perpendicular to the direction of propagation, if we change the direction
                            of any field it well
                            result in corresponding change of the other field. It means that if E-field is vertical, the
                            H-field will be
                            horizontal. Now if we change the position of the E-field from vertical to horizontal, the
                            position of H0field
                            (magnetic field) will also change from horizontal to vertical. If we change the direction of
                            E-field or H-field
                            the direction of propagation will also change if we change the direction of E0field and
                            H-field at the same time
                            the direction of propagation will remain the same.</p>

                    Polarization
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Polarization is a measurement of the electromagnetic field's alignment. In the figure above, the
                    electric field (in red)
                    is vertically polarized. Think of a throwing a Frisbee at a picket fence. In one orientation it will
                    pass through, in
                    another it will be rejected. This is similar to how sunglasses are able to eliminate glare by
                    absorbing the polarized
                    portion of the light.

                    Frequency
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The number of crests that pass a given point within one second is described as the frequency of the
                    wave. One wave—or
                    cycle—per second is called a Hertz (Hz), after Heinrich Hertz who established the existence of radio
                    waves. A wave with
                    two cycles that pass a point in one second has a frequency of 2 Hz.

                    Wavelength
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Electromagnetic waves have crests and troughs similar to those of ocean waves. The distance between
                    crests is the
                    wavelength. The shortest wavelengths are just fractions of the size of an atom, while the longest
                    wavelengths scientists
                    currently study can be larger than the diameter of our planet! More of that in Electromagnetic
                    Spectrum.
