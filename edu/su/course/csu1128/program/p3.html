                    Program which demonstrates use of all operators of arithmatic, modulo, relational, logical bitwise,
                    increment, decrement, assignment, and conditional operators.

                <h4>Details:</h4>
                <p>The code is a C program that demonstrates the use of various operators in the C programming language. These operators
                    include arithmetic, modulo, relational, logical, bitwise, increment, decrement, assignment, and conditional
                    operators.</p>
                <p>At the start of the program, the user is prompted to enter two integer values separated by a space, which are stored
                    in the variables <code>d</code> and <code>m</code>. The program then uses these values to demonstrate the
                    functionality of each type of
                    operator.</p>
                <p>Arithmetic operators include addition <code>+</code>, subtraction <code>-</code>, division <code>/</code>, and
                    multiplication <code>*</code>. The result of each
                    operation is printed to the console with a description of the operator used.</p>
                <p>The modulo operator <code>%</code> returns the remainder of the division of two values. The program demonstrates
                    its use by
                    dividing <code>d</code> by <code>m</code> and printing the result.</p>
                <p>Relational operators are used to compare two values. They include less than <code>&lt;</code>, greater than
                    <code>&gt;</code>, less than or equal
                    to <code>&lt;=</code>, greater than or equal to <code>&gt;=</code>, not equal to <code>!=</code>, and equal to
                    <code>==</code>. The program demonstrates the use
                    of each of these operators by comparing <code>d</code> and <code>m</code> and printing the result.
                </p>
                <p>Assignment operators allow values to be assigned to variables. The program demonstrates the use of the assignment
                    operator <code>=</code> by assigning the value of <code>m</code> to <code>d</code>.</p>
                <p>Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on values. The program demonstrates the use of the equal to
                    <code>==</code> operator, the logical and <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator, and the logical or <code>||</code>
                    operator.
                </p>
                <p>Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on values. The program demonstrates the use of the logical
                    not <code>!</code> operator, the bitwise and <code>&amp;</code> operator, the bitwise or <code>|</code>
                    operator, and the bitwise exclusive or <code>^</code>
                    operator.</p>
                <p>Increment and decrement operators are used to increase and decrease the value of a variable. The program demonstrates
                    the use of the post-increment <code>++</code> and post-decrement <code>--</code> operators.</p>
                <p>Conditional operators allow for the execution of certain statements based on a condition. The program demonstrates
                    the use of the conditional operator if <code>a&gt;b</code> by comparing <code>d</code> and <code>m</code> and printing the
                    value of <code>d</code> if <code>d</code> is
                    greater than <code>m</code>.</p>
                <p>The program concludes by printing a summary of all the operations performed and the results.</p>
