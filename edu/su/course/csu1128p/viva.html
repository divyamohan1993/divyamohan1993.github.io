                <h3>What is the difference between a global variable and a local variable?</h3>
                <p>A global variable is a variable that is declared outside of any function and is accessible to all
                    functions in the
                    program. A local variable, on the other hand, is a variable that is declared inside a function and
                    is only accessible
                    within that function.</p>

                <p>The "main" function is the entry point of a C program. It is the function where the program begins
                    executing and is
                    usually where the majority of the program logic is contained.</p>

                <p>The "if" statement is used to control the flow of a program based on a specific condition. The syntax
                    for an "if"

                <pre><code>

                <h3>How do you declare and use an array in a C program?</h3>
                <p>To declare an array in C, you need to specify the type of data the array will hold and the number of
                    elements it will
                    contain. For example:
                    int array[10];

                    To access an element of the array, you can use the index operator ([]). For example:

                    array[0] = 10;</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between the "for" loop and the "while" loop?</h3>
                <p>The "for" loop is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times. The syntax for a "for"
                    loop in C is as
                    follows:
                    for (initialization; condition; update) {<br>
                    // code to be executed<br>
                    }<br>

                    The "while" loop, on the other hand, is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a
                    specific condition is
                    true. The syntax for a "while" loop in C is as follows:
<br>
                    while (condition) {<br>
                    // code to be executed<br>
                    }<br></p>

            A struct in C is a composite data type that allows you to store a group of related variables under a single name. A
            union, on the other hand, is a composite data type that allows you to store different variables in the same memory
            location. This means that when you use a union, only one of the variables in the union can be stored in memory at any
            given time.
            
            Pointers in C are variables that store the memory address of another variable. You can use pointers to access and modify
            the value of a variable indirectly, rather than directly accessing the variable itself. To declare a pointer in C, you
            use the "*" operator. For example:
            
            int *pointer;
            
            The "const" keyword in C is used to declare a variable as constant, which means that the value of the variable cannot be
            modified after it is initialized. This is useful for ensuring that the value of a variable is not accidentally changed
            by other parts of the program.
            
            The "switch" statement in C is used to execute a block of code based on the value of a specific expression. The syntax
            for a "switch" statement in C is as follows:
            
            switch (expression) {
            case value1:
            // code to be executed if expression == value1
            break;
            case value2:
            // code to be executed if expression == value2
            break;
            ...
            default:
            // code to be executed if expression does not match any of the cases
            }
            
            A static function in C is a function that is only accessible within the file in which it is defined. This means that the
            function cannot be called from other files in the program. A non-static function, on the other hand, is a function that
            is accessible to all parts of the program.

                What is the difference between an "automatic" variable and a "static" variable in C?
                How do you use recursion to solve a problem in C?
                What is the purpose of the "typedef" keyword in C?
                How do you use the "goto" statement in C?
                How do you use the "sizeof" operator in C?

                An "automatic" variable in C is a variable that is created on the stack when a function is called and is automatically
                destroyed when the function returns. A "static" variable, on the other hand, is a variable that is created in memory
                when the program starts and remains in memory until the program ends. This means that a static variable retains its
                value between function calls, whereas an automatic variable does not.
                
                Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem. In C, you can use recursion to
                solve problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently. To use recursion in C, you
                need to define a base case that the function can use to stop calling itself, and you need to make sure that the function
                calls itself with a modified version of the original problem each time it is called.
                
                The "typedef" keyword in C is used to create an alias for a data type. This allows you to use the alias as if it were a
                new data type in your program. For example:
                
                typedef unsigned int UINT;
                
                You can then use the "UINT" type in your program like this:
                
                UINT x;
                
                The "goto" statement in C is used to transfer control to a different part of a program. The syntax for a "goto"
                statement in C is as follows:
                goto label;
                
                ...
                
                label:
                // code to be executed
                
                Using the "goto" statement is generally considered to be bad programming practice, as it can make code harder to read
                and understand.
                
                The "sizeof" operator in C is used to determine the size of a data type or a variable in bytes. For example:
                int x;
                printf("%d\n", sizeof(x)); // prints "4"
                
                You can also use the "sizeof" operator to determine the size of a data type like this:
                
                printf("%d\n", sizeof(int)); // prints "4"

                    What is the difference between a "dynamic" and a "static" memory allocation in C?
                    How do you use the "fopen" and "fclose" functions to read and write to a file in C?
                    What is the difference between a "deep copy" and a "shallow copy" in C?
                    How do you use the "assert" function to test assumptions in a C program?
                    What is the difference between a "blocking" and a "non-blocking" function in C?


                    In C, you can use "dynamic" memory allocation to allocate memory for a variable at runtime, using functions such as
                    "malloc" and "calloc". This means that the amount of memory allocated for the variable is not fixed at compile-time, but
                    can be changed at runtime based on the needs of the program. "Static" memory allocation, on the other hand, is the
                    process of allocating memory for a variable at compile-time, using the "static" keyword. This means that the amount of
                    memory allocated for the variable is fixed at compile-time and cannot be changed at runtime.
                    
                    The "fopen" function in C is used to open a file for reading or writing. The syntax for "fopen" is as follows:
                    
                    FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode);
                    
                    The "filename" argument is the name of the file you want to open, and the "mode" argument specifies whether you want to
                    read from the file ("r"), write to the file ("w"), or append to the file ("a"). To close a file that has been opened
                    with "fopen", you can use the "fclose" function like this:
                    
                    int fclose(FILE *stream);
                    
                    The "stream" argument is a pointer to the file stream you want to close.
                    
                    A "deep copy" in C is a copy of an object that includes not just the values of the object's attributes, but also any
                    dynamically-allocated memory associated with the object. A "shallow copy", on the other hand, is a copy of an object
                    that includes only the values of the object's attributes, and does not include any dynamically-allocated memory
                    associated with the object.
                    
                    The "assert" function in C is used to test assumptions in a program. If the assumption being tested is false, the
                    "assert" function will print an error message and terminate the program. The syntax for "assert" is as follows:
                    
                    assert(expression);
                    
                    If "expression" is true, the "assert" function does nothing. If "expression" is false, the "assert" function prints an
                    error message and terminates the program.
                    
                    A "blocking" function in C is a function that stops the program from executing until it finishes running. A
                    "non-blocking" function, on the other hand, is a function that allows the program to continue running while the function
                    is executing. Non-blocking functions are useful for performing tasks that may take a long time to complete, as they
                    allow the program to continue running and perform other tasks while the function is running.



                    What is the difference between a "preprocessor" directive and a "compiler" directive in C?
                    In C, a "preprocessor" directive is a line of code that begins with a "#" symbol and is processed by the preprocessor
                    before the program is compiled. Preprocessor directives are used to include header files, define macros, and perform
                    other tasks that are not possible using regular C code. A "compiler" directive, on the other hand, is a line of code
                    that is recognized by the compiler and is used to specify compiler options or to include compiler-specific code.
