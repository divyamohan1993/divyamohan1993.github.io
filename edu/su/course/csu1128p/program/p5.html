                    <h3>Difference between Compile time and run time errors.</h3>
                    <article>
                        Compile time errors occur when the code is being compiled, while run time errors occur
                        when code is being executed.
                    </article>
                    <article>Compile time errors are usually syntax errors and can be easily identified and fixed,
                        while run time errors are more
                        difficult to debug.
                    </article>
                    <article>Compile time errors prevent the code from being executed, while run time errors can
                        occur after the code has been
                        successfully compiled.
                    </article>
                    <article>Compile time errors are usually detected by the compiler, while run time errors are
                        usually detected by the program
                        itself.
                    </article>
                    <article>Compile time errors can be fixed by simply correcting the code, while run time errors
                        often require more in-depth
                        debugging and analysis.
