                    <p>The structure of the C language is divided into four main parts:</p>
                    <article>
                        <h4>Preprocessor Directives</h4>
                        <p>These tell the compiler how to compile the program.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h4>Variables and Data Types</h4>
                        <p>Variables are containers that store data, and data types are used to define the type of data
                            stored in a variable.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h4>Functions</h4>
                        <p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task when called.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h4>Statements and Expressions</h4>
                        <p>These are instructions that tell the compiler how to execute the
                            program.</p>
                    </article>

                    Keywords:
                    1. Keywords are predefined words in C language and are used to perform specific tasks.
                    2. Keywords cannot be used as variable names or identifiers as they are already reserved in the
                    language.
                    3. They cannot be changed while writing the program.
                    4. Keywords are always written in lowercase letters.
                    5. Examples of keywords in C language are int, float, if, else, for, while, etc.

                    Constants:
                    1. Constants are fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program.
                    2. They are also referred to as literals.
                    3. Constants can be either character constants, integer constants, floating-point constants, or
                    string literals.
                    4. They can be written in capitals or lowercase letters.
                    5. Examples of constants in C language are 'A', 10, 3.14, and "Hello World".

                    Variables:
                    1. Variables are used to store data in memory while the program is running.
                    2. They can be changed during the execution of a program.
                    3. Variables are user-defined and must be declared before they can be used in the program.
                    4. The value stored in a variable can be changed as per the requirement of the program.
                    5. Examples of variables in C language are int x; float y; char z; etc.
